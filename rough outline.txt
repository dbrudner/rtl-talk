React Testing Library
	1. What
		-A library that provides helper utilities for testing react components
	2. Why I like rtl
		-Enzyme is weird
			-huge api
			-Shallow vs full rendering/diving is weird (at least to me)
			-https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/dive.html (wtf does this even mean?)
			-Directly calling functions on an instance of react class to test state leads to issues
				-Leads to false positives (create example)
				-Users don't care about state. Users care about what they see on the screen
				-should tests care about implementation details?
		-"The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you."
		-https://kentcdodds.com/blog/introducing-the-react-testing-library
		-Tests should act on and query the DOM the same way a user would
		-Users don't query the DOM by IDs or classes or anything like that. They look for inputs with placeholders and labels, buttons with text, etc.
		-So much easier to setup and use**
			-testing should be painless
			-dont write tests that need to be re-written
			-don't strive for code coverage, unless you want to rewrite your shit all the time
		-Enter react-testing-library
